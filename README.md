# beamui

A classical widget toolkit, written entirely in the D language. This is a fork from DlangUI library.

[API documentation](https://dayllenger.github.io/beamui/)

Please note that the library is unstable until v1.0, and minor versions may and will break API and old concepts.

## Build Requirements

You will need *dub* package manager, *dmd* or *ldc* compiler. Other compilers were not tested. Visit [compiler](https://dlang.org/download.html) and [dub](https://code.dlang.org/download) download pages for various installation methods.

On **Windows**, *dmd >= 2.086* or *ldc >= 1.16* are required.
On other platforms, *dmd >= 2.082* or *ldc >= 1.12* should work fine.
